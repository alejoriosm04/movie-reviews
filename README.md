    Movie Reviews üé¨üçø
</h1>

A web application that allows users to leave movie reviews and ratings, built with the MEVN stack.

## Features

- üì• Accepts input of movie title and review from users
- üîç Displays all movie reviews on a single page
- üìä Calculates average rating for each movie
- üîí Requires user login to leave reviews

## Motivation

The main aim of this project was to create a platform for users to share their thoughts on movies and see what others thought as well. Another motivation for this project was to have a personal project to add to my portfolio.

## Method

The MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js) was used to build this application. The front-end was built with Vue.js and the back-end with Node.js and Express. MongoDB was used to store the movie reviews.

Users can log in and leave a review for a specific movie. The review and the movie title are stored in the database. All reviews are displayed on the same page, with the average rating for each movie calculated and displayed as well.

## Try it out

To use this application, users must first create an account and log in. Once logged in, they can leave a review for a specific movie by entering the movie title and their review in the designated fields and submitting the form. All movie reviews can be viewed on the same page.

To try out the application, visit the following website: https://movie-reviews-nine.vercel.app/

Note that this is only a demo version and may not have all features enabled or may not function as expected.
